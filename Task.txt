Validation of data

Create a Valid class in which make the static methods validEmail ($ email) and validURL ($ url).
The implementation of these methods should be as follows: data is empty - throwing an exception, data is incorrect - throwing an exception, data is correct - return true.
Check for various input parameters created methods.
Note: To correctly verify Email and URL, use filter_var ().
